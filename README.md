#### Hello, my name is Riva Davidowski and I'm excited to start on the long journey ahead. Yes, I am a baby coder, a newb to this world of software development. I will fail, I will learn, and by god, I shall succeed! Read below to hear what I have to say about growth mindset and how I plan on pushin' through the tough times.

Growth mindset to me is pushing through the hard times, it's getting up and dusting yourself off after each fall. I can recognize the many ways that the fixed mindset can sneak back in, even when we have the best intentions to stay the course. So, I wanna fight the negative self-talk by sticking to this guide each time I feel like there is no hope.

 I shall remember the words of Andy from the show Parks and Rec. "I was in the pit, you were in the pit, we all were in the pit." There is always a way out of the pit if we keep trying and putting in the work.

> ### A GUIDE TO STAY IN THE GROWTH MINDSET

> - Completely strike the word ***can't*** from my vocabulary. Like this... ~~can't~~ !
> - Make sure that I have experimented with different resources for answers
> - Take a break! I will remind myself that sometimes deep breaths and walking away for a bit can refresh the brain
> - Remember that this is a marathon, and not a sprint. I will **LEARN** if I keep **WORKING**
