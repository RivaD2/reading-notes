#### Hello, my name is Riva Davidowski, baby coder,a newb to this world of software development. Read below to hear what I have to say about Growth Mindset and how I plan on pushin' through the tough times:

Growth mindset to me is pushing through the hard times, it's getting up and dusting yourself off after each fall. I can regcognize the many ways that the fixed mindset can sneak back in, even when we have the best intentions to stay the course. So, I wanna fight the negative self-talk by sticking to this guide each time I feel like there is no hope.
