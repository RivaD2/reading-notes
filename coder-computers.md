# The Coders Computer | A Guide Through Text Editors, Terminal, Command Lines, Basic Navigation and About Files 
###### Those that are new to learning code will find that transforming their computer to a coders computer takes a bit of patience and some help from those that are more experienced.The terminal alone can make you wanna run for the hills! Don't fret, this guide will help you.

You'll start to see that text editors, understanding files and directories, Terminals (and the shell), and navigation around the system using Terminal is all part of your journey in software development. See the links **below** to get started:

## THE TAKEAWAYS:


## What is a Text Editor? Do you believe in Magic?
#### Okay,okay, so it's not quite magic. Text editors will make your life (and coding) easier and here's why:

                    1. They include features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and a variety of themes.
                       (Monokai High Contrast anyone?)
                    2. They have built in extensions, and trust me, you'll need em'
                    3. They allow you to write code more efficiently and mitigate potential errors
                    4. Choosing one is personal, so go out there and find what gets you excited!

## **The Command Line a.k.a. The Terminal | What I've Learned**
#### On a basic level, here is some info that should clear things up:

                    1. You type in commands to the Terminal and feedback will be given back as text
                    2. The command will present you with a prompt
                    3. It is much, much faster than the GUI (Graphical User Interface- umm, "Finder" on Mac, that's a GUI)
                    4. Opening Terminal is easy and changes depending on which computer you're using
                    5. Each Terminal has it's shell, and the shell can change from user to user.
                    6. When things start to get hairy,(and it's bound to happen), use *[Google](https://www.google.com/)
                    

## **Let's Talk about Basic Navigation | Let's Get Movin'**
#### Alright, now that you've identified your shell and opened Terminal, let's get to movin' around the system! Play around with some of the commands below:
            
                    1. When we refer to a file or directory, it is called a Path
                    2. There are (2) types of paths: Absolute and Relative
                    3. `pwd` a.k.a. Print Working Directory- Tells you what your working directory is.
                        It is your current location.
                       (Use this often to know where you are working from)
                    4. `ls` a.k.a. List- It will list your location 
                    5. `cd` a.k.a. Change Directory- Well, this as you can imagine, takes you to another directory
                    
### A word of advice, just remember that the Terminal is powerful and much faster than using you're familiar GUI's
