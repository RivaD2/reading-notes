# SCRIPTS AND JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS
**What is a Script and how is JS used in relation to a script?** **Let's Get Started!**

> Quick reminder...As you can see above, Javascript builds on HTML and CSS to create interactivity.

### Let's Talk about Scripts
--------------------------

*  **A script is a series of instructions that a computer follows and is written by programmers**
*  **A script can be simple, or quite complicated (e.g. a recipe is fairly simple, but a script for a pinball machine is quite complicated)**
*  **A browser may use all of or only parts of a script (it doesn't have to run all code written)**

----------------------------------------
### JavaScript & Expressions

### It is important to note that expressions result into a single value. 
There are two types:

* Expressions that assign value to a variable
* Expressions that use two or more values to **return** a single value

Keep in mind a variable is undefined until you assign a value to it

----------------------------------
### Expressions use Operators:
#### Keep in mind that operators allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values

Here are some examples:
* Comparison Operators ``` 3 > 5; ```   ``` 3 >= 3; ```
* Comparison operators COMPARE two value or expressions
* Comparison operators will return a BOOLEAN value (true or false)
* Strict Equality Operator ``` 3 === 5```
* The strict equality operator will compares equality and type of two values
* Equality Operator ``` 3 == 5; ```
* The equality operator will compare two values to see if they are the same, but not the TYPE

### Ok Let's break this down a bit:
------------------------
> Programmers write scripts that computers run to perform a series of tasks.
> JavaScript relies on expressions, statements, functions, and Objects to tell the script what to do.
