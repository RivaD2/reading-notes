-----------
###### Those that are new to learning code will find that transforming their computer to a coders computer takes a bit of patience and some help from those that are more experienced.The terminal alone can make you wanna run for the hills! Don't fret, this guide will help you.


You'll start to see that text editors, understanding files and directories, Terminals (and the shell), and navigation around the system using Terminal is all part of your journey in software development. See the links **below** to get started:

## **The Command Line a.k.a. The Terminal | What I've Learned**
On a basic level, I've learned:

                    1. You type in commands and feedback will be given as text
                    1. The command will present you with a prompt
                    1. It is much, much faster than the GUI (Graphical User Interface- umm, "Finder" on Mac, that's a GUI)
