*Our good friend Ron Swanson just trashes his computer when he feels his security has been compromised. There's a better way to protect our users and their data.*

**What is Bearer Authentication? A quick recap:**

- Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. We can understand this as  “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources.

**Let's put this together: Here we have a list of steps in the flow of bearer auth and how the flow would work when try to use it. These steps are scrambled. We can't have that! Let's put them together the right way!**

7. Receive access token
4. Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
1. Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
3. Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
2. Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
5. Receive authorization code
6. Make a request to the access token endpoint



- **What can you do with an authorization code?**
I can download files and  I can confirm a user is logged in etc.
There are many, many things we can do with authorization codes.

- **What can you do with an access token?**
I can use them for API's, first party and third party API's for my applications.

- **What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?**
A good example of OAuth in use is logging back into Facebook. Everytime we sign in, it first prompts us to confirm it is infact us trying to login, before entering. Basically, it is asking if it can access data on OUR behalf. This is OAuth in action. It is beneficial because it separates authentication from authorization and gives us limited access to user data. IT PROTECTS THE USER MORE! It also lightens our load as we don't have to manage all the security on the authenciation process and user data. Whew!
