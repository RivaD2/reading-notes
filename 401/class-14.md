**REVIEW**

1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
   Basic Authorization is built into HTTP Protocol. The client sends HTTP requests with standard fields in the header. Basic Auth asks, "Who are you?"
   With Basic Auth we can store encoded passcodes by convenetion and by using various encryption methods and usernames and passwords are sent as Base-64 encoded strings. It requires no handshakes, tokens, cookies, session identifiers, or login pages. 

   Bearer Auth also asks the question, "Who are you?" However, instead of using strings, we move on to using tokens. As Beareer Auth is a token-based system, we still need to remember here that it is a random string used by the server. It is generated by the server in the response to the login request. 

2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?
  JWT is the handshake process that takes place in bearer auth. It provides a way to securly tranmit information between two parties as as a JSON object. They are signed with a secret and are most commonly used in the authorization process. The structure of A JWT is:

      - **Header**
      - **Payload**
      - **Signature**
  They typically take this structure: `xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz`

3. **What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?**
   We never want to push/store any secrets on .git repositories and should always hadd sensitive files into our .gitignore for example. Secrets are called secrets for a reason, they aren't supposed to be shared without caution, and should be shared in an encrypted format. We can use our .env to store them correctly and restrict certain permissions. We can encrypt files using [git-secret](https://git-secret.io/)

   When we create our secrets, using stronger passwords is a good idea and totating them out is even better. There are even secret management systems out there nowadays to help us manage the various secrets we keep(SSH keys, DB passcodes, etc.) According to *hashicorp.com* we should really centralize secrets, keeping them in one place so that security can be easily managed. 

**NEW VOCABULARY TO LEARN**

- **encryption**:Encryption is focused on security. IT srambles data to ensure that unintended recipients are not able to make sense out of data. It is a process of converting data into a code or unreadable format called **cipher text**
- **token:** Generally a token is an object (in software or in hardware) which represents the right to perform some operation. In Bearer Auth, the bearer token is a cryptic string that is generated by the server in response to the login request. If you have the token, you have access. In OAuth, tokens are issued to clients by an authorization server with the
approval of the resource owner. The client uses the access token to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server.

- **bearer**: The bearer is any party in possession of a token. A bearer can then access resources.
- **secret:** Anything that a developer doesn’t want someone else to see. For example, database passcodes, API keys, stuff like that.
- **JSON Web Token:** A JWT pronounced "jot" is a way to securely transmit information between two parties as a JSON object. All JWT's are tokens, but not all tokens are JWTs.
Because they are usually small, when they are encoded and passed in HTML/HTTP environments, they are easier to handle. They can be signed by sharing a secret or using public/private keys pairs. With the user in mind, they are easier to process as well as they are used at internet scale. 

**Here's how they can be used:**

- User logs in succesfully with credentials, a ID token is returned (A JWT)
- Application requests access to routes, services or resources (API's) on behalf of the user
      - To do this, on every request, an ACCESS TOKEN is passed which can be in the form of a JWT
      - The information exchange takes place. JWT's allow us to verify who the senders are and confirm they are who they say they are.
