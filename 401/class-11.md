### WHAT IS BASIC ACCESS AUTHENTICATION?
- [Basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser) to provide a username and password when making a request.
- A client that wants to authenticate itself with the server can do so by including an [Authorization request header](https://www.loginradius.com/engineering/blog/everything-you-want-to-know-about-authorization-headers/) with the credentials.
- Usually a client will present a password prompt to the user and will then issue the request including the correct Authorization header.

**We've learned a bit about building RESTful APIs. Well API's use authorization to ensure that client requests access data securely. This can involve authenticating the sender of a request and verifying that they have permission to access or manipulate the relevant data.**

### WHAT ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF AUTHORIZATION REQUEST HEADERS:

- **Basic Auth:** A simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. The client sends HTTP requests with the Authorization header that contains the word Basic, followed by a space and a base64-encoded(non-encrypted) string username: password.

- **Bearer Token:** Also called token authentication. It is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens.The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request.

- **API Key:** An API key is a token that a client provides when making API calls. With API key auth, you send a key-value pair to the API either in the request headers or query parameters.

- **Digest Auth:** Digest Authentication communicates credentials in an encrypted form by applying a hash algorithm to the username and the password, the password is then converted to response and then it is sent to the server.

- **Oauth 2.0:** OAuth 1.0 permits client applications to access data provided by a third-party API.

- **Hawk Authentication:**
Hawk authentication enables you to authorize requests using partial cryptographic verification.

- **AWS Signature:**
AWS is the authorization workflow for Amazon Web Services requests.

### PASSWORDS...EVERYONE'S GOT EM':

**Everything we do over the internet requires a password. You wanna pay a bill, enter your password. Your rent? Enter a password. You wanna sign in to your Instagram account to see lovely pictures of food? Boom! Password needed! You get the idea right? LET's TALK ABOUT HASHING.**

- **Hashing:** Hashing is the greatest way for protecting passwords and considered to be pretty safe for ensuring the integrity of data or password.
- Hashing in simple terms is taking meaningful value and turning into something meaningless. Ok, let's say it this way. Let's say someone steals the database with hashed passwords. If this happens, they only make off with the hashes and not actual passwords. It will be a heck of a lot harder to crack those codes if they are hashed.

### BCrypt IS CRYPTONITE TO HACKERS:

- BCrypt makes attacks much slower and mitigates impact by using a technique called **key stretching**
- The BCrypt hashing function allows us to build a password security platform that scales with computation power and always hashes every password with a **salt**.
- **WHAT IS A SALT?** This is a better way to store passcodes and it adds additional random data to the input of a hashing function that makes each password hash unique.

### JSON WEB TOKENS:

- JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:
    - Header
    - Payload
    - Signature
- A simple definition of a JSON Web token comes from [medium.com](https://medium.com/ag-grid/a-plain-english-introduction-to-json-web-tokens-jwt-what-it-is-and-what-it-isnt-8076ca679843):A JSON web token, or JWT (“jot”) for short, is a standardized, optionally validated and/or encrypted container format that is used to securely transfer information between two parties.

**Let's revisit some common questions related to data structures and middleware:**

- **Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms):** According to [csharpindepth.com](https://csharpindepth.com/articles/singleton), the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

**WHAT ARE DESIGN PATTERNS?**

- According to **medium.com**, design patterns are reusable, reliable solutions to problems that we face every day in software development. Design patterns are named, cataloged solutions.

- **Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes:**

**For example, let's say we have a class called `collections` that is huge and does a lot of things. With a singleton, when middleware runs, instead of importing the class and creating an instance of it with the `new` keyword, it only imports an instance of the class that has already been created.**

**WHY IS THIS A BIG DEAL?**

- The singleton pattern saves computing time, which makes applications faster. It ensures consistency between classes as they automatically get all the same data using a singleton. THE INSTANCE OF THE CLASS PERSISTS using this pattern.

- **If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?:** In my opinion as a front end focused dev, Express JS is a dream come true as I can use JS on the front end and back end. However, maybe the middleware system of Express isn't best for computation-intensive tasks as it seems like it could really complicated.

### New Vocabulary:

1. **Router Middleware:** Router is used to manage incoming requests. It kind of routes your requests to correct handler/code.

1. **Dynamic Module Loading:**
Really, I default to thinking about the `import()` syntax which allows us to load modules on demand by using promises or the async/await syntax.

1. **Singleton Pattern:** A design pattern that allows us to have an instance of class persist thus saving computing time.

1. **CRUD -> REST Method Matches:**
Create = PUT with a new URI
       = POST to a base URI returning a newly created URI
Read   = GET
Update = PUT with an existing URI
Delete = DELETE

1. **Mock Testing:** It is used in unit testing and in simple terms, mocking is creating objects that simulate the behavior of real objects.
