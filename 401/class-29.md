**Questions that need answering**

1. **Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?**
2. **When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?**

**With the sample code below...**

```
<Main>
<Content />
</Main>
```

3. **Can a component, such as `<Content />`, which is a child, also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?**

4. **What trick can a parent use to share all props with it’s children**


**Vocab to remember**

- `props.children`:
- `composition`:
