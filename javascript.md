## JavaScript adds a dynamic component to webpages.
It allows the user to interact with a page

### JavaScript is the behavior layer of the page. Using JS we add interactivity. 

### Here are some other things to know about JavaScript:
>
> - It is built of variables, functions, statements, loops, arrays, and conditionals
> - It is a front-end programming language and is a key component to **EVERY** site
> - It provides timely content updates, interactive maps, animated graphics and **SO** much more
> - Without JavaScript, a page would just sit there, it'd be static and we don't want that do we?

#### Some other things to consider here:
* It is super important to write comments in your JS code. 
* Why? So you and others will know what your code is doing and what your intentions were when writing a specific piece of code.
* It is best to keep your JavaScript code in it's own little file with a .js extension.

#### Remember, all websites are made up of 3 elements: 
> - HTML (the structure)
> - CSS   (the style)
> - JavaScript (brings functionality and dynamic elements into play)
