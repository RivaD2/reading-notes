**So you wan't to learn how to program? Now what? You learn your ABC's, which in this case, is HTML or (hypertext markup langage). Let's dive in deeper:**

1. There are 3 components that comprise every website and those are: HTML, CSS, and javaScript. 
1. HTML is like the structure, or the bones of the website. 
1. It consists of what are called *"tags"*
A.K.A. *markup*
1. HTML elements include titles, headers, paragraphs, links and SO MUCH MORE.

**SO, now you may be asking many questions, ones like, ok SO who is my site for?**

1. When we build a site, we need to know who our demographic is and what their needs are
1. We need to ask ourselves how to organize our information and ideas first, *before* we even build a site (This is called Wireframing)
1. We need to think about whether the site is static and dynamic--I mean, how often is the content changing?

## Perhaps on of the most important thing to remember, is that THROUGH DESIGN we are COMMUNICATING

1. By making certain elements distinct and using visual hierarchy, we can accomplish wonderful things
1. There is so much more to learn as far as extra markup goes... iframe tags, meta tags and id and class attributes are just the beginning.
