### Hello, my name is Riva Davidowski and I'm excited to start on the long journey ahead. I started learning code on my own and have found it to be one of the most satisfying (and most challenging) endeavors of my life thus far.  All I can do now is keep practicing, keep believing in my ability to learn, and buckle up for the bumpy ride ahead.

### Growth mindset to me is pushing through the hard times, it's getting up and dusting yourself off after each fall. I can recognize the many ways that the fixed mindset can sneak back in, even when we have the best intentions to stay the course. So, I'm gonna fight the negative self-talk and use this guide to pull me back to the right mindset:



## MY GUIDE TO STAY IN THE GROWTH MINDSET
>
> - Completely strike the word ***can't*** from my vocabulary. Like this... **~~can't~~** !
> - Make sure that I have experimented with different resources for answers
> - Remind myself that learning can be uncomfortable and that I know more than I think I do
> - Take a break! I will remind myself that sometimes deep breaths and walking away for a bit can refresh the brain
> - Remember that this is a marathon, and not a sprint. I will **LEARN** if I keep **WORKING**

> As you can see, I am a Buffy fan and so I feel it necesary to say that we can take a page outta' her book. Look, the going gets tough, sometimes I don't believe in myself. But deep down I know that if I hang in there and keep pushing myself, I'll make it through.

**I shall remember the words of Andy from the show Parks and Rec when I feel like I can't succeed:**
>  "I was in the pit, you were in the pit, we all were in the pit"**

**There is always a way out of the pit, but we may have to crawl out slowly before we reach the top**
