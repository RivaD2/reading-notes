### Hello, my name is Riva Davidowski and I'm excited to start on the long journey ahead. I started learning code on my own and have found it to be the most satisfying (and most challenging) endeavor of my life thus far.  All I can do now is keep practicing, keep believing in my ability to learn, and buckle up for the bumpy ride ahead.

#### Read below to hear what I have to say about growth mindset and how I plan on pushin' through the tough times. 
Feel free of course to check out my profile: <https://github.com/RivaD2>

-----------------------------------

### Growth mindset to me is pushing through the hard times, it's getting up and dusting yourself off after each fall. I can recognize the many ways that the fixed mindset can sneak back in, even when we have the best intentions to stay the course. So, I wanna fight the negative self-talk by sticking to this guide each time I feel like there is no hope.

### As you can see, I am a Buffy fan and so I feel it necesary to say that we can take a page outta' her book. Look, the going gets tough, sometimes I don't believe in myself. But deep down I know that if I hang in there and keep pushing myself, I'll make it through.

**I shall remember the words of Andy from  the show Parks and Rec when I feel like I can't succeed. "I was in the pit, you were in the pit, we all were in the pit..." There is always a way out of the pit, but we may have to crawl out slowly before we reach the top**
