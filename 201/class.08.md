#### Learning the key ways we can position elements in CSS will prevent us from improvising our way through it and will make a page much more attractive.

# CSS LAYOUT CONTINUED 
-----------
### I touched on CSS [layout](https://rivad2.github.io/reading-notes/201/class-04.html) previously and hopefully you remember that in CSS, each HTML element has its very own box. I also mentioned what inline and block elements are. Let's expand on this:**
  1. Block level boxes start on a new line and inline boxes flow between surrounding layers of text
  1. To control how much space each box will take up, set a width (and a height too if you're feeling frisky!)
  3. IF one block-level element sits inside another, then the outer box is called the **CONTAINING/PARENT** element
  4. Using a`<div>` to hold a bunch  of similar elements together will help keep you nice and organized---just remember in that case, the div would be a **CONTAINING** element

  ** You now know that CSS has several positioning schemes that can change the layout of the page: normal, relative, and absolute: 
  * To change positioning use the *position* property and to change float elements, use the *float* property
    * The float property is worth calling out here as it allows you to place an element left or right of the containing element. The float property has proved itself to be quite handy indeed!
  * **Normal flow** is the default way browswers read HTML elements
