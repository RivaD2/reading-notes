# JS OBJECT LITERALS AND THE DOM 
### When I'm finished covering object literals and the DOM, you may be saying this:

### Don't worry my friend, with practice, you will grow to love the DOM and come to realize the power it contains!
--------------------------------
### What is an Object| JS Object Literals
#### Remember when we learned about html boxes, and boxes upon boxes? Ok, good. Here are some extra pointers on objects and literal notation:
* Each html element has a box
* For each box, there is an object that we can interact with
* The browser actually uses a data structure to represent the boxes 
* This structure is called the **DOM (Document Object Model)**-(**THE DOM CREATES A MODEL OF YOUR WEB PAGE**)
* The DOM technically sits inside of the **BOM (BROWSER OBJECT MODEL)
* The DOM has a hierarchy which comes in the form of a tree. Please see the structure of the DOM [here](https://eloquentjavascript.net/14_dom.html)


### WHAT IS AN OBJECT AND WHAT ARE OBJECT LITERALS?
* Objects group together variables and functions to create something similar to what you would see in the real world (like a car, a restaurant, etc.)
* In an object, variables and functions take on new names

#### IN AN OBJECT VARIABLES BECOME PROPERTIES AND FUNCTIONS BECOME METHODS. 
* Methods represent tasks that are connected to the object
* Object literals are used often and save coders time by creating a model of an object
* Using the two ways to construct an object, we can change the properties of that object faster and at anytime

#### USING THE DOM GIVES US ACCESS TO PROPERTIES OR METHODS OF AN OBJECT. THIS IS WHEN THE MAGIC HAPPENS!!

* We access the properties of an object using dot notation or constructor notation
* As I've discussed previously, there are two ways to create object and those are: **literal notation** and **constructor notation

Please read my other page that covers literal notation and contructor notation. Click [here](https://github.com/RivaD2/reading-notes/blob/master/201/class-04.md).

### SEE, I bet you're feeling a little better huh?

#### Just remember that objects represent a model of something real and that the DOM uses objects to represent a page. 

#### We can access those objects using dot notation and constructor notation and can build objects using constructor notation and literal notation.

#### By creating objects and utilizing properties and methods, we are using Object Oriented programming and this my friend, is a gamechanger
