## IMAGES
#### Images are all around us and they come in many forms, shapes and sizes. It is true that an image can grab you and communicate a message in an instant. Let's take a look at choosing images for your site and how it works:

* Images should be relevant, convey information, convey the right mood, be recognisable, fit your color palette
* Keep your images in a separate folder, because as your site grows, this will keep you organized
* To add an image to an HTML page, do this:

```
<!--Use the img tag + src + alt + self closing tag-->
<!--You can also add in a <title> tag -->
<img src="source lives here and is usually a URL" alt="description of image"/>
```
* It is important to know that **WHERE** you place your images in your code will **AFFECT** how it is displayed (Read more [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp) about image placement)
* Use GIF or PNG format when saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color, and JPEG when there are many colors in an image

## CSS COLOR

#### Color adds life to our pages and using CSS, there are many ways to alter color in both the foreground and background of our page. Let's get to it:

* Computer monitors are made up of tiny squares called pixels
* The color of every pixel is expressed in terms of RGB (red, green, and blue)
We can use the following to specify colors:
1. **RGB Values**: expressed in numbers 0-255
2. **Hex Codes**: Represent values for red, green and blue using hexdecimal codes (read about [HEXCODES](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/))
3. **Color Names**:Colors are represented through names (red, green, blue etc.) but BEWARE, your choices are limited if you choose this route
4. **HSL Colors**:CSS3 uses hue, saturation and lightness to determine a color

### When all hope is lost, and the darkness surrounds you, CHOOSE A COLOR PICKER

## TEXT | IT'S A BIG DEAL MAN

#### In CSS, there are properties that determine your choice of font, size, style,  and spacing. Let's learn a bit more about text in CSS:

* There are limited fonts you can choose from as browsers will only display fonts installed on a users computer
* However, there are other ways to get fonts and you can find those ways [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_fonts.asp)
* Here are some examples of how we can get specific with text in CSS:

Use a back up font after your chosen font, and separate them with a comma

```
font-family: Georgia, Times;
font-size: 12px;
```

#### There are three **psuedo-classes** that allow us to change the appearance of elements when a user interacts with them:

1. :hover (this is applied when a user hovers over an element with a mouse)
2. : active (This is applied when an element is **ACTIVATED** by a user...pressing a button or clicking)
3. : focus (This is applied to an element with focus, elements with focus include any that you can interact with)
