# What Google Learned From Its Quest To Build A Perfect Team
-----
### We've all been a part of a team at some point or another in our lives. We could have been on a team at work or at school. Even partnerships are a team. Let's look at some fundamentals of how a truly exceptional team operates.

**After reading this [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) from *The New York Times Magazine*, it is clear that there is more to a great team than just high performers. There is SO, SO MUCH MORE. Some key takeaways:**

* Employee performance optimization IS NOT enough these days-- we have to dig deeper into what makes a great team well...GREAT
* Collaborative activities are growing as modern work is becoming team-based (Why do you think you always see the **"must be a team player"** on those job descriptions you were looking at?)
* Groups tend to innovate faster, find better solutions to problems and report higher job satisfaction
* Combining the best people together or grouping people based on personality traits and tendencies isn't the answer

## PROJECT ARISTOTLE studied hundreds of Google's teams to figure out what made some teams excel and others fail

**As you can imagine, a lot of data was gathered but no patterns emerged as quickly as they'd hoped. So, They focused their research on **GROUP NORMS** and quickly found patterns emerge**

* It turns out, that the researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams
* The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘good’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. 
* The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.
* First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking
* good teams members were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues 

## ABOVE ALL ELSE, WHAT TRULY CAN HELP A TEAM TO SUCCEED IS PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY...
>"The behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond. And those human bonds matter as much at work as anywhere else. In fact, they sometimes matter more."

**More Key Takeaways:**

* We want to be ourselves at work, not put parts of ourselves away in a box and then pretend to be someone else when we're at work
* We need to feel free to share, to shine, to fail, to be vulnerable when we are at work (within reason of course)
* We want to be heard
* We need to focus a bit more on empathy and sensitivity in teamwork
* Sometimes success of a team is not measured by productivity, but rather experiences

### "Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it’s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences — like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel — that can’t really be optimized."
