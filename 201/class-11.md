### We've covered that images can be a powerful tool to convey meaning and emotion on a page. But how can we manipulate the images we've chosen to work with our page? Let's take a look!

* To control the size, use the *width* and *height* properties in CSS
* When you specify image size, this actually helps the page to load more smoothly. **HOW?** Because by specifying a size, we are actually telling the browser to just leave space for the image and this way, it can work on rendering the rest of the page

### Previously I spoke about the *float* property and how it allows text to flow around it by moving an element to the left or right. Well, the float property is also a great way to align images:

1. The float property can be added to a class (.small, or .large for example)
1. New classes can be created with names like *align-left* or *align-right*. These classes are used in addition to the ones specifying the size of the image

#### Some other ways to align images:

1. Adding a margin to an image is common as margins will prevent text from creeping up to close to the edges 
1. Remember, that by default images are *inline* elements which means they will always flow within the surrounding text
1. In order to *center* an image, it needs to be turned into a block-level element using the *display* property with the value of *block*
  * Once an image is a block-level element, you can use the *text-align* property with the value of *center* to center an image
  * Or, to center an image, you can use the *margin* property and set the value to *auto*

### It is time to get practical! Let's talk about SEO and analytics

#### You've heard about how important SEO is and you know what SEO stands for (Search Engine Optimization). As you can imagine, it is a subject entirely of its own but it is important to cover some of the key concepts:

* SEO helps your site appear closer to the top of search results when users look for information related to your site
* The very core of SEO are **keywords** or which terms people will enter in the search engine and then idenfying which places to use these keywords on your site to optimize results
* **On-page techniques** are ways you can improve your rating on search engines
* **Off-page techniques** involve other sites linking to **you** and part of SEO is how search engines rank you based off the amount of pages that link to your site
* Content that is related to the type of content on your page is particularly relevant

### In every webpage, there are seven places that keywords can appear to improve your results:

1. Page title
1. URL/web address
1. Headings
1. Text
1. Link Text
1. Image Alt Text
1. Page Descriptions

### You're probably saying, "OK, OK, I get how SEO works but HOW do I determine WHICH keywords to use?"

### I agree with you, targeting keywords is a daunting task that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy! However, it is a task that must be done so let's look into some ways that will help you:

1. Use that big ol' brain to **BRAINSTORM** --- List words you think someone might type in to find your page
1. Get **ORGANIZED** --- Group keywords into separate lists
1. Hit the books! **RESEARCH** --- Get help from [keyword tools](https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/)
1. **COMPARE** --- keyword research sites can help you gauge your competition
1. Get precise and **REFINE** --- Pick which keywords you will focus on and make sure they are relevant to each section of your site
1. **MAP** them out! --- Choose which keywords will go on each page and pick 3-5 keyword phrases that map to each page of your site

#### You have a site, and now the visitors are arriving... This is when you have more data to work with and can start analyzing how they found it and what their purpose is for taking a look at your site. Here's some information you may want to know:

1. Visits - How many times have people actually visited your site?
1. Unique Visits - This would be the total amount of people that have visited your site over a time period (one month, two weeks etc.)
1. Page Views - How many pages have visitors actually looked at? 
1. Pages per visit - What is the average number of pages each person has looked at?
1. Average Time Spent - How LONG have visitors actually spent on your site

### AS I SAID BEFORE, SEO IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF BEAST. NOW THAT YOU KNOW A BIT MORE ABOUT IT, ASK YOURSELF THE FOLLOWING:

* What are my visitors looking at, what are they interested in?
* Where are they even coming from? Have they been linked to me from other pages?
* What is my [Domain Name](https://domains.google/learning-center/how-to-come-up-with-a-good-domain-name/) and good god, have I uploaded it to a web server?
