## Structure: Why it Matters
-----------
#### Think about every article, every blog, every site or book you've ever read...You probably noticed something. Yeah, you got it! There is a structure to the pages, and a noticeable hierarchy of information. Let's talk about HTML:
- HTML pages are text documents
- The structure of pages helps readers to understand information
- HTML (Hypertext Markup language) describes the structure of pages and an HTML document starts with the document declaration: ```<!DOCTYPE.HTML>```
- HTML uses **Elements** to describe the structure and each element has an opening and closing tag: 
* ```<html></html>```   (Tags act like containers)
* ```<body></body>``` (Tags tell us something about the info inside of them and they come in pairs)

#### Look at each element below, and you'll start to understand how you can begin to build a page:
``` 
<!DOCTYPE.html>
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Basic html</h1>
        <p> Why structure Matters</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

Opening tags carry **Attributes**--These provide additional information and consist of a **name** and a **value** 
```
<p lang="en-us"> This will be a paragraph in English</p>
```

1. Every HTML doc carries an **ID ATTRIBUTE** which identifies each element from other elements on the page. 
1.Think of ID attributes (A.K.A. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES) AS THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OF ELEMENTS -each one is unique and be used on any element

The attribute  in the above example is "lang" and the value is inside of the tags

## Extra Markup: The Evolution of HTML
--------
#### Like all things, HTML has evolved and there are several versions out there
* Like the iPhone, each new version of HTML was designed to better than the last
* Evolution of HTML into different types requires that each webpage begin with the DOCTYPE declaration (which I covered above)
* This declaration tells the browser which version is being used
* It should be mentioned that commenting out your code as you work is helpful to you but ALSO EVERYONE ELSE
* Comments are not visible to the browser and they look like this:
```<!-- I am writing a comment -->```


## Process & Design: Where do we even start when we want to build a site?
--------
You start by asking yourself these questions:

* Who is the site for? (the target audience)
* Why people visit your site (Why are they coming?)
* What are their motivations? (Tasks and motivations?)
* What info do they need? (What info is most important?)
* How often people will visit site (Updating much?)

#### Have you heard of WireFraming? It is a simple sketch of vital information that needs to be added to each page of a site. Read about them [here](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-wireframe/).

## Introduction to JavaScript: A, B & C ![intro](https://media.giphy.com/media/yUTmg5PbrRLXi/giphy.gif)


### A: What is a script
1. A script is a series of instructions that a computer uses to accomplish a goal
1. Scripts are precise, step-by-step instructions and scripts run code or sections of code in response to input 
1. Set the goal for your script and break down each task into steps. This is a computer accomplishes a task--very different than how we humans do it 

### B: How do computers fit in with the world
1. Look, a computer sees the world in terms of data-programmers then make models using data
1. In computer world, each physical thing is an **OBJECT** and each object has **PROPERTIES**
1. Each property is a name/value pair--these PAIRS tell us about the object
1. **EVENTS** - They are behavior that occurs as a result of input being received. 
### C: How do I even write a script? 
1. Writing a script requires HTML, CSS, and JavaScript working together 
1. Each language is a layer and each has it's own purpose
