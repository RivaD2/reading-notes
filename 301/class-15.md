# DIVERSITY & INCLUSION IN TECH | WHY IT MATTERS
**Diversity and inclusion conversations are tricky for sure, but they are necessary now more than ever. Meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters and now a number of companies and leaders are confronting these issues for the first time** 

### Paradigm is a company that spent time brainstorming with CEOs and other company leaders about what is or should be driving their diversity and inclusion efforts. Here are five themes that emerged from their conversations:

1. **Diverse teams are smarter and more creative:** When you think about it, this of course makes perfect sense. If you have diversity on your teams, problems are seen in many different ways and can be solved much faster. 
2. **Diverse companies perform better:** 
> In a 2011 study of diversity in the top firms in Standard & Poor's Composite 1500 list, researchers found “female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.”
>
3. **Companies are losing out on great talent:** Failing to attract and hire employees from underrepresented backgrounds leads companies to miss out on incredible talent. Think about this, we all come from different backgrounds and each of us has our own experiences and knowledge to bring to the table. Without diversity, teams limit themselves to only one kind of experience or rather, without diversity, "...biases and life experiences result in referral networks that are very homogeneous."
4. **Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base:** When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. What does this mean? This means that without having diversity in our teams, how could we possibly represent the diversity of our users in what we build? Users come from different countries, backgrounds, religions, experiences and cultures. So, we need to mirror that diversity in teams.
5. **It’s the right thing to do** : Let's put profitablilty aside here. Think about this from a moral standpoint...why hasn't been diversity been a priority in the past? We could go down many roads here but on a very basic level, diversity on teams is not only fair and intelligent, it is the right thing to do morally. Why build team after team the same way over and over. That'd be like eating the same kind of ice cream for the rest of you life! Diversity is what brings better ideas, better solutions, more creativity and richness into our teams. We learn more, we grow more and we are able to do more on a team that is diverse.

### Talking about diversity is not easy but it is an important first step to see and understand these trends and work on ways that we as individuals can be a voice for diversity. 
**Ultimately, diversity on teams does fall onto leadership. However, we as individuals and teammates can have a voice in this matter and let it be known that we not only value diversity but we want to SEE more of it on our own teams and in our workforce**
