# COMMIT TO GIT #
**We tell Git to commit,  but really, we gotta commit to learning Git**

> Think of Git as a gatekeeper, a close friend that just happens to be the most popular Version Control System out there.

### So, What is Git Anyway? What Does it Do?
--------------------------

*  **Git is a version control system (VCS)**
*  **Git stores data in snapshots**
*  **Each time updates to a file are made, programmers ask git to "commit"**
      `commit = save` 
*  **Git greatly mitigates damage to files as it tracks every change to every file and directory**
* **Git allows to work collaboratively on the same programming projects**



### Git's State of Mind: The three states of Git
----------------------------
##### Files In Git Reside in 3 main states:
* **Modified: File has changed but has not been 
              committed**
* **Staged: Once an update is made, Git flags the files updated version to be committed**
* **Committed: Once a file is committed, it is stored in local history***

### Is that for Git? Not Even Close'
