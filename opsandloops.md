### Ok, so we've learned that JavaScript is reactive, it responds to what the user does. But how does it do that? Let's cover some more ground:
>
> - There are rules associated with expressions, strings, fucntions and methods
> - An array is another type of variable, it just can hold more than one value *
> - A string stores a series of characters like this `"John Doe"`
> - Mixing a string and a number = a string
> - Using an arithmetic operator on a string is NO BUENO and will result in NaN (not a number)

### LET'S GET LOOPY|FUNCTIONS, METHOD AND LOOPS

--------------------------

> - Functions are a series of statements grouped together to perform a certain task and can be reused to repeat that said task
   * Very important to note that when you ask a function to perform a task, it is known as **CALLING THE FUNCTION**
> - Objects are made up of property and methods and we will learn over time that EVERYTHING is an object
> - Methods are the same as a function except they are created INSIDE an object
> -Programming languages rely on name value pairs

## LOOPS - What do they do?: 
#### Well, they check a condition
#### IF the condition is true, a code block is run
#### There are 3 TYPES:

> - For Loops: Used to run code a specific number of times
> - While Loops: Used when number of times code should run is unknown
> - Do While Loops: Similar to while loops but will ALWAYS RUN statements in curly braces AT LEAST once even if condition is false
