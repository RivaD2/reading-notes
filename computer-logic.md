# DEMYSTIFYING THE COMPUTER | HOW THEY WORK

###Computers can be intimidating right? I learned the acronym "**I** **S** **P** **O**"

#### Now I see that really, they aren't so scary. There's much to learn but under the hood, 4 basic operations are happening:
-----------
## I = INPUT
* A computer takes various forms of input and stores it in its memory. Input comes in various forms : the touch of our finger, controlling a thermostat, typing on our keyboard etc. It's what we TELL the computer to do

## S = STORE
* Once a computer has received input(in all its various forms), it stores it in its memory and  sends it to the CPU (which is the processor A.K.A. Central Processing Unit). It has many circuits and it KNOWS what circuit to use when. It's NUTS!

## P = PROCESSING
* The computer takes the information (all the input) from memory and changs that information. It sends that information back to be stored again and again until it's time for output. 

## O = OUTPUT
* A computer takes all that stored input and outputs information in SO MANY WAYS. Seriously, it's amazing. It can display some of following:
* text
* audio
* video

### OPERATING SYSTEMS| THE MASTER PROGRAMS
--------------------
* It is super **special**- It controlls the software on your computer
* It decides when a program is run
* The OS is quickly switching between programs,  allowing us to search the web, message, and work on projects all at once. 

#### REMEMBER THIS! The only thing that makes a computer useful is the programmer! It takes people like you and me, to write those programs.
